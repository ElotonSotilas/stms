# stms
A simple task management system written in React using Spring JPA and H2 database.

## Fair warning

As of 1st May 2022, this application is incomplete. It is made as a job application for Object Systems International.

Things to note that are not complete (most of them due to the lack of time on my end, and a very few just because of my lack of knowledge):
- Other React application pages (due to time, only have a demo for account ready)
- Points 2c (started but incomplete), 3 and 4. I did not add search as asked from point 5, because I forgot to do so earlier and it's already late to do this, so I just left it as is, but it will fetch all available tasks.

As it stands, I think I did OK, but there are definitely things I still need to work on.

## Notice

This is the first time I am writing code in Java and JavaScript. I am surprised I got this far in just 5 days. (I started this Wednesday, if I recall correctly)
